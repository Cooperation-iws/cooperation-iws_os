RMOD_VERBOSE_FR="Postfix est un logiciel d'envoi d'e-mails (SMTP entre autre). Dovecot est un logiciel de réception d'email POP3 et IMAP."
RMOD_VERBOSE="What is Postfix? It is Wietse Venema's mailer that started life at IBM research as an alternative to the widely-used Sendmail program. Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and secure. The outside has a definite Sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different. Dovecot is an open source IMAP and POP3 server for Linux/UNIX-like systems, written with security primarily in mind. Dovecot is an excellent choice for both small and large installations. It's fast, simple to set up, requires no special administration and it uses very little memory. "

# Main configuration file for the MailScanner E-Mail Virus Scanner
#
# It's good practice to check through configuration files to make sure
# they fit with your system and your needs, whatever you expect them to
# contain.
#
# Note: If your directories are symlinked (soft-linked) in any way,
#       please put their *real* location in here, not a path that
#       includes any links. You may get some very strange error
#       messages from some of the virus scanners if you don't.
#
# Note for Version 4.00 and above:
#       A lot of the settings can take a ruleset as well as just simple
#       values. These rulesets are files containing rules which are applied
#       to the current message to calculate the value of the configuration
#       option. The rules are checked in the order they appear in the ruleset.
#
# Note for Version 4.03 and above:
#       As well as rulesets, you can now include your own functions in
#       here. Look at the directory containing Config.pm and you will find
#       CustomConfig.pm. In here, you can add your own "value" function and
#       an Initvalue function to set up any global state you need such as
#       database connections. Then for a setting below, you can put:
#               Configuration Option = &ValueFunction
#       where "ValueFunction" is the name of the function you have
#       written in CustomConfig.pm.
#
# Note for Version 4.54 and above:
#       Numbers can be scaled by 1 thousand, 1 million or 1 billion by
#       putting a "k", "m" or "g" immediately after the number. You must
#       *not* put any spaces between the number and the k, m or g.
#

#
# Definition of variables which are substituted into definitions below.
#
# You can add any %variables% that you want to use in addition to the
# ones provided.
#
# You can also use any shell environment variables here such as $HOSTNAME
# or ${HOSTNAME} in configuration settings and rulesets. See the
# definition of "Hostname" for an example.
#

# Enter a short identifying name for your organisation below, this is
# used to make the X-MailScanner headers unique for your organisation.
# Multiple servers within one site should use an identical value here
# to avoid adding multiple redundant headers where mail has passed
# through several servers within your organisation.
#
# Note: Some Symantec scanners complain (incorrectly) about "."
# ***** characters appearing in the names of headers.
#       Some other mail servers complain about "_" characters
#       appearing in the names of headers as well.
#       So don't put "." or "_" in this setting.
#
# **** RULE: It must not contain any spaces! ****

# Enter the location of your organisation's web site below. This is used

# How many MailScanner processes do you want to run at a time?
# There is no point increasing this figure if your MailScanner server
# is happily keeping up with your mail traffic.
# If you are running on a server with more than 1 CPU, or you have a
# high mail load (and/or slow DNS lookups) then you should see better
# performance if you increase this figure.
# If you are running on a small system with limited RAM, you should
# note that each child takes just over 20MB.
#
# As a rough guide, try 5 children per CPU. But read the notes above.

# How often (in seconds) should each process check the incoming mail

# want to increase this value so it causes less load on your server, at
# the cost of slightly increasing the time taken for an average message
# to be processed.

# 3. The name of a file containing a list of directory names,
#    which can in turn contain wildcards.
#    Example: /etc/MailScanner/mqueue.in.list.conf
#
# If you are using sendmail and have your queues split into qf, df, xf
# directories, then just specify the main directory, do not give me the
# directory names of the qf,df,xf directories.
# Example: if you have /var/spool/mqueue.in/qf
#                      /var/spool/mqueue.in/df
#                      /var/spool/mqueue.in/xf

# If this is set to yes, then email messages passing through MailScanner

#
# The purpose of this option is to set it to be a ruleset, so that you

#   To:       bad.customer.com  no
#   From:     ignore.domain.com no
#   FromOrTo: default           yes
# That will scan all mail except mail to bad.customer.com and mail from

# This feature is dangerous as it can allow viruses to be fetched from
# other Internet sites by a user's email package. The user would just
# think it was a normal email attachment and would have been scanned by
# MailScanner.
# It is only currently supported by Netscape 6 anyway, and the only people

# or credit card details.
# Except it is not the real bank's web site at all, it is a very good copy
# of it run by thieves who want to steal your personal information or
# credit card details.
# These can be spotted because the real address of the link in the message

# If this is set to no, then just the company name and country (and any
# names between the two, dependent on the specific country) must match.
# This is not as strict as it will not protect you against internal
# malicious sites based within the company being abused. For example, it would
# not find www.nasty.company-name.co.uk pretending to be
# www.nice.company-name.co.uk. But it will still detect most phishing attacks

# Attachment Filename Checking
# ----------------------------
#

# To simplify web-based configuration systems, there are now two extra

# that you would expect to find in %rules-dir%. The first gives a list
# of patterns to match against the attachment filenames, and a filename
# is allowed if it matches any of these patterns. The second gives the
# the equivalent list for patterns that are used to deny filenames.
# If either of these match at all, then filename.rules.conf is ignored
# for that filename.
# So you can easily have a set like this:
# Allow Filenames = \.txt$ \.pdf$
# Deny  Filenames = \.com$ \.exe$ \.cpl$ \.pif$
# which is a lot simpler than having to handle filename.rules.conf!
# It is far simpler when you want to change the allowed+denied list for
# different domains/addresses, as you can use the filename of a simple

#           Allow Filenames = \.exe$

# SpamAssassin is not very fast when scanning huge messages, so messages
# bigger than this value will be truncated to this length for SpamAssassin
# testing. The original message will not be affected by this. This value
# is a good compromise as very few spam messages are bigger than this.
#
# Now for the options:
# 1) <length of data in bytes>
# 2) <length of data in bytes> trackback
# 3) <length of data in bytes> continue <max extra bytes allowed>
#
# 1) Put in a simple number.
#    This will be the simple cut-off point for messages that are larger than
#    this number.
# 2) Put in a number followed by 'trackback'.
#    Once the size limit is reached, MailScanner reverses towards the start
#    of the message, until it hits a line that is blank. The message passed
#    to SpamAssassin is truncated there. This stops any part-images being
#    passed to SpamAssassin, and so avoids rules which trigger on this.
# 3) Put in a number followed by 'continue' followed by another number.
#    Once the size limit is reached, MailScanner continues adding to the data
#    passed to SpamAssassin, until at most the 2nd number of bytes have been
#    added looking for a blank line. This tries to complete the image data
#    that has been started when the 1st number of bytes has been reached,
#    while imposing a limit on the amount that can be added (to avoid attacks).
#
# If all this confuses you, just leave it alone at "40k" as that is good.

# This replaces the SpamAssassin configuration value 'required_hits'.

# What to do with spam

# This is a list of actions to take when a message is spam.
# It can be any combination of the following:
#    deliver                 - deliver the message as normal

#    forward user@domain.com - forward a copy of the message to user@domain.com
#    striphtml               - convert all in-line HTML content to plain text.
#                              You need to specify "deliver" as well for the
#                              message to reach the original recipient.
#    attachment              - Convert the original message into an attachment
#                              of the message. This means the user has to take
#                              an extra step to open the spam, and stops "web

#    notify                  - Send the recipients a short notification that
#                              spam addressed to them was not delivered. They

# cause the MailScanner logs to go into the same place as all your other
# mail logs.

# Do you want to log the processing speed for each section of the code
# for a batch? This can be very useful for diagnosing speed problems,

# spam statistics from your logs, but can increase the system load quite
# a bit if you get a lot of spam.

# all the SpamAssassin reports of mail that was marked as non-spam.
# Note: It will generate a lot of log traffic.

# Advanced SpamAssassin Settings
# ------------------------------
#
# If you are using Postfix you may well need to use some of the settings
# below, as the home directory for the "postfix" user cannot be written
# to by the "postfix" user.
# You may also need to use these if you have installed SpamAssassin
# somewhere other than the default location.
#

# The per-user files (bayes, auto-whitelist, user_prefs) are looked
# for here and in ~/.spamassassin/. Note the files are mutable.
# If this is unset then no extra places are searched for.
# If using Postfix, you probably want to set this as shown in the example
# line at the end of this comment, and do
#      mkdir /var/spool/MailScanner/spamassassin
#      chown postfix.postfix /var/spool/MailScanner/spamassassin
# NOTE: SpamAssassin is always called from MailScanner as the same user,
#       and that is the "Run As" user specified above. So you can only
#       have 1 set of "per-user" files, it's just that you might possibly
#       need to modify this location.
#       You should not normally need to set this at all.
#SpamAssassin User State Dir = /var/spool/MailScanner/spamassassin
SpamAssassin User State Dir = /var/lib/MailScanner

# This setting is useful if SpamAssassin is installed in an unusual place,
# e.g. /opt/MailScanner. The install prefix is used to find some fallback
# directories if neither of the following two settings work.
# If this is set then it adds to the list of places that are searched;
# otherwise it has no effect.

# The site-local rules are searched for here, and in prefix/etc/spamassassin,
# prefix/etc/mail/spamassassin, /usr/local/etc/spamassassin, /etc/spamassassin,
# /etc/mail/spamassassin, and maybe others.
# Be careful of setting this: it may mean the spam.assassin.prefs.conf file
# is missed out, you will need to insert a soft-link with "ln -s" to link
# the file into mailscanner.cf in the new directory.
# If this is set then it replaces the list of places that are searched;
# otherwise it has no effect.
#SpamAssassin Local Rules Dir = /etc/MailScanner/mail/spamassassin

# there. Otherwise it will ignore all your current rules!
# The default location may be /var/opt on Solaris systems.

# Advanced Settings
# -----------------
#
# Don't bother changing anything below this unless you really know
# what you are doing, or else if MailScanner has complained about
# your "Minimum Code Status" setting.
#

# When trying to work out the value of configuration parameters which are
# using a ruleset, this controls the behaviour when a rule is checking the
# "To:" addresses.
# If this option is set to "yes", then the following happens when checking
# the ruleset:
#   a) 1 recipient. Same behaviour as normal.
#   b) Several recipients, but all in the same domain (domain.com for example).
#      The rules are checked for one that matches the string "*@domain.com".
#   c) Several recipients, not all in the same domain.
#      The rules are checked for one that matches the string "*@*".
#
# If this option is set to "no", then some rules will use the result they
# get from the first matching rule for any of the recipients of a message,
# so the exact value cannot be predicted for messages with more than 1
# recipient.
#
# This value *cannot* be the filename of a ruleset.
Use Default Rules With Multiple Recipients = no

# When putting the value of the spam score of a message into the headers,
# how do you want to format it. If you don't know how to use sprintf() or
# printf() in C, please *do not modify* this value. A few examples for you:
# %d     ==> 12
# %5.2f  ==> 12.34
# %05.1f ==> 012.3
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Spam Score Number Format = %d

# This is the version number of the MailScanner distribution that created
# this configuration file. Please do not change this value.
MailScanner Version Number = 4.58.9

# Do not change this unless you absolutely have to, these numbers have
# been carefully calculated.
# They affect the length of time that different types of message are
# stored in the SpamAssassin cache which can be configured earlier in
# this file (look for "Cache").
# The numbers are all set in seconds. They are:
# 1. Non-Spam cache lifetime                           = 30 minutes
# 2. Spam (low scoring) cache lifetime                 = 5 minutes
# 3. High-Scoring spam cache lifetime                  = 3 hours
# 4. Viruses cache lifetime                            = 2 days
# 5. How often to check the cache for expired messages = 10 minutes
SpamAssassin Cache Timings = 1800,300,10800,172800,600

# Set Debug to "yes" to stop it running as a daemon and just process
# one batch of messages and then exit.
Debug = no

# Do you want to debug SpamAssassin from within MailScanner?
Debug SpamAssassin = no

# Set Run In Foreground to "yes" if you want MailScanner to operate
# normally in foreground (and not as a background daemon).
# Use this if you are controlling the execution of MailScanner
# with a tool like DJB's 'supervise' (see http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html).
Run In Foreground = no

# If you are using an LDAP server to read the configuration, these
# are the details required for the LDAP connection. The connection
# is anonymous.
#LDAP Server = localhost
#LDAP Base   = o=fsl
#LDAP Site   = default

# This option is intended for people who want to log more information
# about messages than what is put in syslog. It is intended to be used
# with a Custom Function which has the side-effect of logging information,
# perhaps to an SQL database, or any other processing you want to do
# after each message is processed.
# Its value is completely ignored, it is purely there to have side
# effects.
# If you want to use it, read CustomConfig.pm.
Always Looked Up Last = no

# This option is intended for people who want to log per-batch information.
# This is evaluated after the "Always Looked Up Last" configuration option
# for each message in the batch. This is looked up once for the entire batch.
# Its value is completely ignored, it is purely there to have side effects.
# If you want to use it, read CustomConfig.pm.
Always Looked Up Last After Batch = no

# When attempting delivery of outgoing messages, should we do it in the
# background or wait for it to complete? The danger of doing it in the
# background is that the machine load goes ever upwards while all the
# slow sendmail processes run to completion. However, running it in the
# foreground may cause the mail server to run too slowly.
Deliver In Background = yes

# Attempt immediate delivery of messages, or just place them in the outgoing
# queue for the MTA to deliver when it wants to?
#      batch -- attempt delivery of messages, in batches of up to 20 at once.
#      queue -- just place them in the queue and let the MTA find them.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset. For example, you could use a
# ruleset here so that messages coming to you are immediately delivered,
# while messages going to any other site are just placed in the queue in
# case the remote delivery is very slow.
Delivery Method = batch

# Are you using Exim with split spool directories? If you don't understand
# this, the answer is probably "no". Refer to the Exim documentation for
# more information about split spool directories.
Split Exim Spool = no

# Where to put the virus scanning engine lock files.
# These lock files are used between MailScanner and the virus signature
# "autoupdate" scripts, to ensure that they aren't both working at the
# same time (which could cause MailScanner to let a virus through).
Lockfile Dir = /var/lock/subsys/MailScanner

# Where to put the code for your "Custom Functions". No code in this
# directory should be over-written by the installation or upgrade process.
# All files starting with "." or ending with ".rpmnew" will be ignored,
# all other files will be compiled and may be used with Custom Functions.
Custom Functions Dir = /etc/MailScanner/CustomFunctions

# How to lock spool files.
# Don't set this unless you *know* you need to.
# For sendmail, it defaults to "posix".
# For sendmail 8.12 and older, you will probably need to change it to flock,
# particularly on Linux systems.
# For Exim, it defaults to "posix".
# No other type is implemented.
Lock Type = 

# Minimum acceptable code stability status -- if we come across code
# that's not at least as stable as this, we barf.
# This is currently only used to check that you don't end up using untested
# virus scanner support code without realising it.
# Levels used are:
# none          - there may not even be any code.
# unsupported   - code may be completely untested, a contributed dirty hack,
#                 anything, really.
# alpha         - code is pretty well untested. Don't assume it will work.
# beta          - code is tested a bit. It should work.
# supported     - code *should* be reliable.
#
# Don't even *think* about setting this to anything other than "beta" or
# "supported" on a system that receives real mail until you have tested it
# yourself and are happy that it is all working as you expect it to.
# Don't set it to anything other than "supported" on a system that could
# ever receive important mail.
#
# READ and UNDERSTAND the above text BEFORE changing this.
