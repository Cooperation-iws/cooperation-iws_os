It can deliver a robust enterprise-level Web site, empowered by endless extensibility for your bespoke publishing needs. Moreover, it is often the system of choice for small business or home users who want a professional looking site that's simple to deploy and use. <em>We do content right</em>.<br /> </p><p>So what's the catch? How much does this system cost?</p><p> Well, there's good news ... and more good news! Joomla! 1.5 is free, it is released under an Open Source license - the GNU/General Public License v 2.0. Had you invested in a mainstream, commercial alternative, there'd be nothing but moths left in your wallet and to add new functionality would probably mean taking out a second mortgage each time you wanted something adding!</p><p>Joomla! changes all that ... <br />Joomla! is different from the normal models for content management software. For a start, it's not complicated. Joomla! has been developed for everybody, and anybody can develop it further. It is designed to work (primarily) with other Open Source, free, software such as PHP, MySQL, and Apache. </p><p>It is easy to install and administer, and is reliable. </p><p>Joomla! doesn't even require the user or administrator of the system to know HTML to operate it once it's up and running.</p><p>To get the perfect Web site with all the functionality that you require for your particular application may take additional time and effort, but with the Joomla! Community support that is available and the many Third Party Developers actively creating and releasing new Extensions for the 1.5 platform on an almost daily basis, there is likely to be something out there to meet your needs. Or you could develop your own Extensions and make these available to the rest of the community. </p>";s:8:"fulltext";s:0:"";s:5:"state";s:1:"1";s:9:"sectionid";s:1:"4";s:4:"mask";s:1:"0";s:5:"catid";s:2:"29";s:7:"created";s:19:"2006-10-09 07:49:20";s:10:"created_by";s:2:"62";s:16:"created_by_alias";s:0:"";s:8:"modified";s:19:"2007-11-04 15:50:34";s:11:"modified_by";s:2:"62";s:11:"checked_out";s:1:"0";s:16:"checked_out_time";s:19:"0000-00-00 00:00:00";s:10:"publish_up";s:19:"2006-10-07 10:00:00";s:12:"publish_down";s:19:"0000-00-00 00:00:00";s:6:"images";s:0:"";s:4:"urls";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";s:231:"show_title=

But for many people, the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for developers all around the world to create powerful add-ons that are called <strong>Extensions</strong>. An Extension is used to add capabilities to Joomla! that do not exist in the base core code. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available Extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Dynamic form builders</li>   <li>Business or organisational directories</li>   <li>Document management</li>   <li>Image and multimedia galleries</li>   <li>E-commerce and shopping cart engines</li>   <li>Forums and chat software</li>   <li>Calendars</li>   <li>E-mail newsletters</li>   <li>Data collection and reporting tools</li>   <li>Banner advertising systems</li>   <li>Paid subscription services</li>   <li>and many, many, more</li> </ul> <p>You can find more examples over at our ever growing <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a>. Prepare to be amazed at the amount of exciting work produced by our active developer community!</p><p>A useful guide to the Extension site can be found at:<br /><a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/" target="_blank" title="Guide to the Joomla! Extension site">http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/</a> </p> <h3>Types of Extensions </h3><p>There are five types of extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Components</li>   <li>Modules</li>   <li>Templates</li>   <li>Plugins</li>   <li>Languages</li> </ul> <p>You can read more about the specifics of these using the links in the Article Index - a Table of Contents (yet another useful feature of Joomla!) - at the top right or by clicking on the <strong>Next </strong>link below.<br /> </p> <hr title="Components" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_com.png" border="0" alt="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Components</h3> <p>A Component is the largest and most complex of the Extension types.  Components are like mini-applications that render the main body of the  page. An analogy that might make the relationship easier to understand  would be that Joomla! is a book and all the Components are chapters in  the book. The core Article Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_content</font>), for example, is the  mini-application that handles all core Article rendering just as the  core registration Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_user</font>) is the mini-application  that handles User registration.</p> <p>Many of Joomla!'s core features are provided by the use of default Components such as:</p> <ul>   <li>Contacts</li>   <li>Front Page</li>   <li>News Feeds</li>   <li>Banners</li>   <li>Mass Mail</li>   <li>Polls</li></ul><p>A Component will manage data, set displays, provide functions, and in general can perform any operation that does not fall under the general functions of the core code.</p> <p>Components work hand in hand with Modules and Plugins to provide a rich variety of content display and functionality aside from the standard Article and content display. They make it possible to completely transform Joomla! and greatly expand its capabilities.</p>  <hr title="Modules" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_mod.png" border="0" alt="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Modules</h3> <p>A more lightweight and flexible Extension used for page rendering is a Module. Modules are used for small bits of the page that are generally  less complex and able to be seen across different Components. To  continue in our book analogy, a Module can be looked at as a footnote  or header block, or perhaps an image/caption block that can be rendered  on a particular page. Obviously you can have a footnote on any page but  not all pages will have them. Footnotes also might appear regardless of  which chapter you are reading. Simlarly Modules can be rendered  regardless of which Component you have loaded.</p> <p>Modules are like little mini-applets that can be placed anywhere on your site. They work in conjunction with Components in some cases and in others are complete stand alone snippets of code used to display some data from the database such as Articles (Newsflash) Modules are usually used to output data but they can also be interactive form items to input data for example the Login Module or Polls.</p> <p>Modules can be assigned to Module positions which are defined in your Template and in the back-end using the Module Manager and editing the Module Position settings. For example, "left" and "right" are common for a 3 column layout. </p> <h4>Displaying Modules</h4> <p>Each Module is assigned to a Module position on your site. If you wish it to display in two different locations you must copy the Module and assign the copy to display at the new location. You can also set which Menu Items (and thus pages) a Module will display on, you can select all Menu Items or you can pick and choose by holding down the control key and selecting multiple locations one by one in the Modules [Edit] screen</p> <p>Note: Your Main Menu is a Module! When you create a new Menu in the Menu Manager you are actually copying the Main Menu Module (<font face="courier new,courier">mod_mainmenu</font>) code and giving it the name of your new Menu. When you copy a Module you do not copy all of its parameters, you simply allow Joomla! to use the same code with two separate settings.</p> <h4>Newsflash Example</h4> <p>Newsflash is a Module which will display Articles from your site in an assignable Module position. It can be used and configured to display one Category, all Categories, or to randomly choose Articles to highlight to Users. It will display as much of an Article as you set, and will show a <em>Read more...</em> link to take the User to the full Article.</p> <p>The Newsflash Component is particularly useful for things like Site News or to show the latest Article added to your Web site.</p>  <hr title="Plugins" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_plugin.png" border="0" alt="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Plugins</h3> <p>One  of the more advanced Extensions for Joomla! is the Plugin. In previous  versions of Joomla! Plugins were known as Mambots. Aside from changing their name their  functionality has been expanded. A Plugin is a section of code that  runs when a pre-defined event happens within Joomla!. Editors are Plugins, for example, that execute when the Joomla! event <font face="courier new,courier">onGetEditorArea</font> occurs. Using a Plugin allows a developer to change  the way their code behaves depending upon which Plugins are installed  to react to an event.</p>  <hr title="Languages" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_lang.png" border="0" alt="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" title="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Languages</h3> <p>New  to Joomla! 1.5 and perhaps the most basic and critical Extension is a Language. Joomla! is released with multiple Installation Languages but the base Site and Administrator are packaged in just the one Language <strong>en-GB</strong> - being English with GB spelling for example. To include all the translations currently available would bloat the core package and make it unmanageable for uploading purposes. The Language files enable all the User interfaces both Front-end and Back-end to be presented in the local preferred language. Note these packs do not have any impact on the actual content such as Articles. </p> <p>More information on languages is available from the Joomla! help site: Language Packs and Localised Releases<br />   <a href="http://help.joomla.org/content/view/1651/243/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! help site: Language Packs and Localised Releases">http://help.joomla.org/content/view/1651/243/</a></p>";s:8:"fulltext";s:0:"";s:5:"state";s:1:"1";s:9:"sectionid";s:1:"4";s:4:"mask";s:1:"0";s:5:"catid";s:2:"29";s:7:"created";s:19:"2006-10-11 06:00:00";s:10:"created_by";s:2:"62";s:16:"created_by_alias";s:0:"";s:8:"modified";s:19:"2007-11-08 14:49:48";s:11:"modified_by";s:2:"62";s:11:"checked_out";s:1:"0";s:16:"checked_out_time";s:19:"0000-00-00 00:00:00";s:10:"publish_up";s:19:"2006-10-10 22:00:00";s:12:"publish_down";s:19:"0000-00-00 00:00:00";s:6:"images";s:0:"";s:4:"urls";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";s:231:"show_title=
