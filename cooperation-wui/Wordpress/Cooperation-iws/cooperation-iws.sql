With a community as vocal as this one, it&#8217;s always a little nerve-wracking to introduce change, but this time it seems like the change was welcomed, which has been great. I&#8217;m hopeful that as we introduce the new features of 2.7 over the coming weeks, the good feelings will continue. As promised, here&#8217;s a rundown of what&#8217;s going to happen to the Dashboard over the next couple of weeks before launch.</p>\n<p><strong>Menus</strong><br />\nI described the menu functions last week, but I forgot to mention something. By default, when you arrive at your Dashboard the first time, two sections of the navigation will be expanded: the Dashboard section (because it is active, so it will have the color highlight) and the Posts section (because it has often-accessed screens in it, and will serve as a cue that you can view other section menus without loading new screens). Once you start clicking menus open and closed, your browser will cookie you, and will remember your menu state. So if you open Posts and Comments, when you come back the next time, Posts and Comments will be open. If you click into your Settings, Posts and Comments will still be open. You&#8217;ll need to manually close nav sections. We went back and forth on this, and there was community discussion about perhaps only allowing two sections to be open at a time, but ultimately those approaches would have removed control from the user. And since the mantra of 2.7 is to give the user control over his/her admin interface, we chose to keeps things open if the user had opened them.</p>\n<p><strong>Contextual Access Tabs</strong><br />\nIn the upper right, drop-tabs provide access to contextual features displayed in a layer that appears between the header and the main working area. Screen Options will allow you to choose which modules to display on the current screen. Don&#8217;t like seeing the Incoming Links module because no one links to you? A simple checkbox in the Options tab will remove the module from your Dashboard until you decide to reinstate it. Help will highlight some of the changes since the previous version, and provide links to help resources such as FAQ/Forums/Contact Support for .com and Documentation/Support Forums for .org.</p>\n<p><strong>Module Layout</strong><br />\nIn addition to using the Options tab to decide which modules to display on the Dashboard, all the modules on the Dashboard may be moved up or down or between columns using drag and drop. Modules also may be collapsed or expanded by clicking the title bar, allowing another level of screen customization. In 2.8, we also hope to make every single module configurable in terms of what content it displays&#8230; we ran out of time for this in 2.7, so for now only the newsfeed modules will be configurable. When you hover over the module, a link will appear in the module header  allowing access to the configuration view.</p>\n<p><strong>Right Now</strong><br />\nThe Right Now module contains the same data as before, but it&#8217;s been rearranged to provide a clearer display. This list style, as opposed to the previous sentence style, will also make translation for non-English sites easier. Color cues help to highlight things that are not good (red), things that are pending (yellow/orange), and things that are good to go (green).</p>\n<p><strong>Stats</strong><br />\nI&#8217;d like to apologize for having a non-core piece of functionality on the Dashboard comp. It&#8217;s my fault&#8230; when we were working on the comps, we used my wireframes and my live 2.7 Dashboard to assemble our elements, and I forgot that I had the <a title="WordPress.com stats plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/">WordPress.com stats plugin</a> installed and a module on my Dashboard. So even though it&#8217;s not in core and it turns out the WordPress.com stats plugin is undergoing some reworking of its own, we made the Dashboard stats module easier to scan than the one I currently see when I log in. For those of you on .org who got excited when you saw the Dashboard comp with stats, again, I apologize for the oversight on my part. If you want the candy-like stats goodness we comped up you&#8217;d need to install the plugin (or another stats plugin with candy-like elements). There should be a fine-looking Dashboard module as part of the update they release. </p>\n<p><strong>QuickPress</strong><br />\nQuickPress is a new feature that provides the ability to start (or publish) a simple post from the Dashboard when you don&#8217;t need the full feature set of the Add New Post screen. Currently, these posts can contain title, text, media and tags. In 2.8 we hope to make the module configurable, so that each user can decide which few fields make the most sense to display. If you Save as Draft, you will see the new draft appear in the Recent Drafts module right away. Clicking Cancel will clear the form. Publish publishes the post. Posts made using QuickPress are the same as other posts and may be editing by going to Posts &gt; Edit and selecting the post in question. One last thing: both in this module and on the Add New post screen, we&#8217;ve put as much space as possible between the Save Draft and Publish buttons, so for all of you who&#8217;ve asked at WordCamps or emailed or posted somewhere to request this, ta da! Hopefully this will reduce accidental publications.</p>\n<p><strong>Recent Drafts</strong><br />\nDuring the summer testing, one thing we heard over and over was the desire to access recent drafts more easily, preferably with one click from the Dashboard (as opposed to clicking on Drafts from the Right Now module, waiting for page to load, then clicking on a specific draft title and waiting for a second page load). The Recent Drafts module is meant to address that need, displaying the five most recent drafts with the date they were created. In a future version, this module will be configurable as well. In the meantime, if you&#8217;re a crosswords-in-pen kind of person and you don&#8217;t write drafts, just use the Options tab at the top to hide the Drafts module, and it won&#8217;t take up space on your Dashboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Feeds</strong><br />\nNews feeds of WordPress-related news will function largely the same as they did in 2.6 in terms of configurability, and will simply have a new look. You can still specify the URL of the feed, how many items to display, whether to show headline vs excerpt, author, date, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Incoming Links</strong><br />\nJust getting a face lift. Or maybe not a face lift, more like a visit to the Clinique counter.</p>\n<p><strong>Hooks</strong><br />\nPlugins can still add modules to the Dashboard. They also still can add top-level menu items if necessary (as opposed to having them in Tools, Plugins, Settings or wherever&#8230;like Posts if it&#8217;s post-specific). Because we&#8217;ll be using iconography in the collapsed menu state, plugins that create top-level menus can create an icon for use in the menu system. When there&#8217;s no icon associated with the plugin, a default will be used (kind of the way some blogs show default avatars when no Gravatar is associated with a commenter on your blog). Hopefully, though, most plugins will fit within existing section headers, since our &#8220;top level&#8221; is not actually made up of menu items, but section headers that open to reveal the real menu items that have screens associated with them. Plugins can also put themselves into the Shortcuts/Favorites menu in the header. </p>\n<p><strong>Recent Comments</strong><br />\nThis module, as in 2.6, displays the most recent comments. However, you now can moderate comments directly from this Dashboard module, including the new Comment Reply feature. For now it will show only the last x number of comments, as it does currently, though in 2.8 we hope to add more configurability to this, or roll it into the Inbox concept.</p>\n<p><strong>Bye-Bye Inbox</strong><br />\nFor those who were at WordCamp SF or who were using the nightly builds while there was still an Inbox placeholder, sorry, no Inbox in 2.7. It turned out to be far more complex than anticipated, and rather than including something rushed and clunky, we&#8217;re holding off until a later version. We added the comment moderation to the Comments module to make up for it, so you don&#8217;t have to wait for that, at least.</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s the new Dashboard. A little more usable, a little prettier, a little more you, a little cooler. Or maybe a lot of all those things. We&#8217;ll let you be the judge.</p>\n";}s:3:"wfw";a:1:{s:10:"commentrss";s:67:"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/10/the-new-27-dashboard/feed/";}s:7:"summary";s:335:"First, I&#8217;d like to say that I&#8217;m glad the majority response to the screenshots we posted last week was so positive.

With a community as vocal as this one, it&#8217;s always a little nerve-wracking to introduce change, but this time it seems like the change was welcomed, which has been great. I&#8217;m hopeful that as we introduce the new features of 2.7 over the coming weeks, the good feelings will continue. As promised, here&#8217;s a rundown of what&#8217;s going to happen to the Dashboard over the next couple of weeks before launch.</p>\n<p><strong>Menus</strong><br />\nI described the menu functions last week, but I forgot to mention something. By default, when you arrive at your Dashboard the first time, two sections of the navigation will be expanded: the Dashboard section (because it is active, so it will have the color highlight) and the Posts section (because it has often-accessed screens in it, and will serve as a cue that you can view other section menus without loading new screens). Once you start clicking menus open and closed, your browser will cookie you, and will remember your menu state. So if you open Posts and Comments, when you come back the next time, Posts and Comments will be open. If you click into your Settings, Posts and Comments will still be open. You&#8217;ll need to manually close nav sections. We went back and forth on this, and there was community discussion about perhaps only allowing two sections to be open at a time, but ultimately those approaches would have removed control from the user. And since the mantra of 2.7 is to give the user control over his/her admin interface, we chose to keeps things open if the user had opened them.</p>\n<p><strong>Contextual Access Tabs</strong><br />\nIn the upper right, drop-tabs provide access to contextual features displayed in a layer that appears between the header and the main working area. Screen Options will allow you to choose which modules to display on the current screen. Don&#8217;t like seeing the Incoming Links module because no one links to you? A simple checkbox in the Options tab will remove the module from your Dashboard until you decide to reinstate it. Help will highlight some of the changes since the previous version, and provide links to help resources such as FAQ/Forums/Contact Support for .com and Documentation/Support Forums for .org.</p>\n<p><strong>Module Layout</strong><br />\nIn addition to using the Options tab to decide which modules to display on the Dashboard, all the modules on the Dashboard may be moved up or down or between columns using drag and drop. Modules also may be collapsed or expanded by clicking the title bar, allowing another level of screen customization. In 2.8, we also hope to make every single module configurable in terms of what content it displays&#8230; we ran out of time for this in 2.7, so for now only the newsfeed modules will be configurable. When you hover over the module, a link will appear in the module header  allowing access to the configuration view.</p>\n<p><strong>Right Now</strong><br />\nThe Right Now module contains the same data as before, but it&#8217;s been rearranged to provide a clearer display. This list style, as opposed to the previous sentence style, will also make translation for non-English sites easier. Color cues help to highlight things that are not good (red), things that are pending (yellow/orange), and things that are good to go (green).</p>\n<p><strong>Stats</strong><br />\nI&#8217;d like to apologize for having a non-core piece of functionality on the Dashboard comp. It&#8217;s my fault&#8230; when we were working on the comps, we used my wireframes and my live 2.7 Dashboard to assemble our elements, and I forgot that I had the <a title="WordPress.com stats plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/">WordPress.com stats plugin</a> installed and a module on my Dashboard. So even though it&#8217;s not in core and it turns out the WordPress.com stats plugin is undergoing some reworking of its own, we made the Dashboard stats module easier to scan than the one I currently see when I log in. For those of you on .org who got excited when you saw the Dashboard comp with stats, again, I apologize for the oversight on my part. If you want the candy-like stats goodness we comped up you&#8217;d need to install the plugin (or another stats plugin with candy-like elements). There should be a fine-looking Dashboard module as part of the update they release. </p>\n<p><strong>QuickPress</strong><br />\nQuickPress is a new feature that provides the ability to start (or publish) a simple post from the Dashboard when you don&#8217;t need the full feature set of the Add New Post screen. Currently, these posts can contain title, text, media and tags. In 2.8 we hope to make the module configurable, so that each user can decide which few fields make the most sense to display. If you Save as Draft, you will see the new draft appear in the Recent Drafts module right away. Clicking Cancel will clear the form. Publish publishes the post. Posts made using QuickPress are the same as other posts and may be editing by going to Posts &gt; Edit and selecting the post in question. One last thing: both in this module and on the Add New post screen, we&#8217;ve put as much space as possible between the Save Draft and Publish buttons, so for all of you who&#8217;ve asked at WordCamps or emailed or posted somewhere to request this, ta da! Hopefully this will reduce accidental publications.</p>\n<p><strong>Recent Drafts</strong><br />\nDuring the summer testing, one thing we heard over and over was the desire to access recent drafts more easily, preferably with one click from the Dashboard (as opposed to clicking on Drafts from the Right Now module, waiting for page to load, then clicking on a specific draft title and waiting for a second page load). The Recent Drafts module is meant to address that need, displaying the five most recent drafts with the date they were created. In a future version, this module will be configurable as well. In the meantime, if you&#8217;re a crosswords-in-pen kind of person and you don&#8217;t write drafts, just use the Options tab at the top to hide the Drafts module, and it won&#8217;t take up space on your Dashboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Feeds</strong><br />\nNews feeds of WordPress-related news will function largely the same as they did in 2.6 in terms of configurability, and will simply have a new look. You can still specify the URL of the feed, how many items to display, whether to show headline vs excerpt, author, date, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Incoming Links</strong><br />\nJust getting a face lift. Or maybe not a face lift, more like a visit to the Clinique counter.</p>\n<p><strong>Hooks</strong><br />\nPlugins can still add modules to the Dashboard. They also still can add top-level menu items if necessary (as opposed to having them in Tools, Plugins, Settings or wherever&#8230;like Posts if it&#8217;s post-specific). Because we&#8217;ll be using iconography in the collapsed menu state, plugins that create top-level menus can create an icon for use in the menu system. When there&#8217;s no icon associated with the plugin, a default will be used (kind of the way some blogs show default avatars when no Gravatar is associated with a commenter on your blog). Hopefully, though, most plugins will fit within existing section headers, since our &#8220;top level&#8221; is not actually made up of menu items, but section headers that open to reveal the real menu items that have screens associated with them. Plugins can also put themselves into the Shortcuts/Favorites menu in the header. </p>\n<p><strong>Recent Comments</strong><br />\nThis module, as in 2.6, displays the most recent comments. However, you now can moderate comments directly from this Dashboard module, including the new Comment Reply feature. For now it will show only the last x number of comments, as it does currently, though in 2.8 we hope to add more configurability to this, or roll it into the Inbox concept.</p>\n<p><strong>Bye-Bye Inbox</strong><br />\nFor those who were at WordCamp SF or who were using the nightly builds while there was still an Inbox placeholder, sorry, no Inbox in 2.7.

The menu system in particular has been the topic of discussion on the hackers and testers lists, so I thought I would take this opportunity to explain how we plan for it to work. As you know, one of the goals of 2.7 was to reduce the necessity to load new screens just to access sub-navigation menus; we wanted the most-used screens to be within a click or two at most. If you&#8217;ve been using the nightly builds, you got used to the arrow controls that allowed you to expand and contract the menus. Then you got used to the box-style with icons that not only opened and closed vertically, but could be minimized horizontally as well, leaving a remnant of icons to provide a kind of &#8220;advanced mode,&#8221; though you don&#8217;t need to be particularly advanced to use it. Now that we have real button styles (the icons are still placeholders, and we hope to have some new ones soonish), we&#8217;ve nailed down the menu functionality.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 607px"><img title="2.7 New Post Screen, Unfinished" src="http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/newpost.png" alt="2.7 New Post Screen, Unfinished" width="597" height="402" /><p class="wp-caption-text">2.7 New Post Screen, Unfinished</p></div>\n<p>Each section header has three parts: the icon on the left, the blue link text, and the area to the right where an expansion arrow appears on hover or in expanded state. You can see that the arrow is contained in a small segment of the header, similar to the way the favorites menu is structured. If you click on this segment, the menu will expand to show the choices in that section.  Click again to close the menu. Click on the blue link text and you will go directly to the screen for the first choice in that section, where the section menu will be opened to show you the other section choices. Double-click on the section icon and the menu will close horizontally, leaving the icon list visible. In this state, hovering over the icons will display the menus for each section, so you&#8217;re still only a click away from most screens.

These are a guide, not a dictate. Changes may be made by developers and designers as needed for technical, aesthetic and/or usability reasons. When you have a team of superfast developers like we do, sometimes wireframes can become out of date quickly. In the two hours since these wireframes were approved, for example, already there are a few things that have moved and a menu change or two. Tweaks will continue to be made over the next week or two before freeze. This is Alpha software, not Beta, and it&#8217;s not static. That&#8217;s part of what makes it exciting, that every time it&#8217;s updated there&#8217;s something new.</p>\n<p>2. These are all black/grey/white. That&#8217;s because we have a designer hard at work on visual styles for the new admin panel, including color palette, fonts, graphic elements, etc. When we have a new look to show off, we will. For now, the wireframes are &#8220;lookless&#8221; on purpose.</p>\n<p>3. Not every screen is wireframed. We focused on creating wireframes for those screens that are undergoing the most change. For screens retaining largely the same functionality and layout, we have not included wireframes. In some cases, we&#8217;ll be updating screens but haven&#8217;t decided how to do it yet, so those aren&#8217;t included either.</p>\n<p>4.

The decisions that went into 2.7 were based on a combination of usability testing results from 2.5 and Crazyhorse (both including laser eye tracking, official report to be released soon, but <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/edanzico/riding-the-crazyhorse-future-generation-wordpress-presentation">slides from WordCamp SF</a> available in meantime), community feedback, personal and professional opinions, and some thinking about where the next couple of versions will be going in terms of new features, so that we will have a design that scales to accommodate some the features we hope to incorporate in the future.</p>\n<p>So, I hope you enjoy getting an inside look at how we&#8217;ve been organizing our thoughts around 2.7, and that when the community feedback starts flowing everyone remembers that we all want the same thing: the best WordPress possible.</p>\n";}s:3:"wfw";a:1:{s:10:"commentrss";s:70:"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/10/wordpress-27-wireframes/feed/";}s:7:"summary";s:349:"For those of you who have been downloading the nightly builds or contributing code to 2.7, you&#8217;ve noticed how quickly features are being added, small layout changes are gradually being implemented, and the application is morphing before your very eyes.

The decisions that went into 2.7 were based on a combination of usability testing results from 2.5 and Crazyhorse (both including laser eye tracking, official report to be released soon, but <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/edanzico/riding-the-crazyhorse-future-generation-wordpress-presentation">slides from WordCamp SF</a> available in meantime), community feedback, personal and professional opinions, and some thinking about where the next couple of versions will be going in terms of new features, so that we will have a design that scales to accommodate some the features we hope to incorporate in the future.</p>\n<p>So, I hope you enjoy getting an inside look at how we&#8217;ve been organizing our thoughts around 2.7, and that when the community feedback starts flowing everyone remembers that we all want the same thing: the best WordPress possible.</p>\n";}i:6;a:12:{s:5:"title";s:70:"WordPress 2.7 UI Survey #2: Search box, Favorites menu, Future Publish";s:4:"link";s:66:"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/09/wordpress-2-7-survey-no2/";s:8:"comments";s:75:"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/09/wordpress-2-7-survey-no2/#comments";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sun, 28 Sep 2008 17:56:13 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:10:"Jane Wells";}s:8:"category";s:60:"User Interfacefavoritesfuturepublishsearchsurveywordpress2.7";s:4:"guid";s:39:"http://wordpress.org/development/?p=327";s:11:"description";s:359:"October 1, 2008 Update: The survey is now closed.

I won&#8217;t go into too much detail, but I&#8217;ll try to point out what it is about each theme that might make it attractive to a developer using WordPress as a site platform.<br />\n<span id="more-1165"></span></p>\n<h3><a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/">Sandbox</a></h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned Sandbox numerous times before, and it is the current underpinning for this site. Unlike the other themes mentioned below, Sandbox is not designed to be pretty out-of-the-box &#8212; you have to add your own design work.While it does come with some sample stylesheets which demonstrate placing sidebars on the left, right, or one on either side, it&#8217;s up to you to touch it up with graphics, colors, typography, etc.</p>\n<p>What Sandbox does is to provide a semantically rich framework to hang your own visual design on. Sandbox&#8217;s class generation functions have become the inspiration for many other themes that followed. It also gives you hAtom and hContact <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a>, which can be consumed by web tools like the <a href="http://flock.com/">Flock browser</a> or <a href="http://developer.search.yahoo.com/wizard/index">Yahoo&#8217;s SearchMonkey</a>.</p>\n<h3><a href="http://www.techtrot.com/primepress/">PrimePress</a></h3>\n<p>PrimePress has strong semantic underpinnings, but also pays a lot of attention to the design and typography of the site. One interesting feature is that it lets you create your own <code>custom.css</code> file for overriding its styles. Just put your own rules in there, and the theme will automatically load them up.</p>\n<p>This theme supports rotating header images, and there is an article on the site explaining how to modify the theme to support per-page custom header images.</p>\n<h3><a title="Thematic for WordPress" href="http://themeshaper.com/thematic-for-wordpress/">Thematic</a></h3>\n<p>Thematic is a highly adaptable, <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization"><span class="caps">SEO</span></acronym>-friendly theme, which was based on Sandbox. It comes with a nice visual style, and some stylesheet variations which give you different sidebar configuations. The sample themes are based on the <a title="960 Grid System" href="http://960.gs/">960px grid system</a> which is becoming more and more popular. What&#8217;s particularly interesting about this theme is that it gives you 13 separate widget containers to work with.</p>\n<p>There also some <a href="http://themeshaper.com/blog/functions-php-wordpress-child-themes/">child themes</a> available for Thematic which show off how you can really change the layout of a site with nothing more than a new stylesheet: <a href="http://www.themelab.com/2008/08/30/monochromatic-a-thematic-child-theme/">Monochromatic</a>, <a href="http://patdryburgh.net/blamatic/">Blamatic</a>, <a href="http://patdryburgh.net/junction/">Junction</a></p>\n<h3><a title="Agregado Lifestream Theme" href="http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2008/09/08/agregado-lifestream-theme-for-wordpress-released/">Agregado</a></h3>\n<p>This one isn&#8217;t as generically useful as the others, but is still quite interesting. Agregado is geared towards highlighting your &#8220;lifestream&#8221;, an aggregated view of your activity on a variety of social networking sites. It can collect your updates from Twitter, Flickr, Delicious, Last.fm, Facebook, and a ton of other sites, displaying them prominently in the sidebar next to your blog posts. And it&#8217;s wrapped up in a pretty design, to boot. You might not use it much for client work, but it&#8217;s a heck of an interesting starting point for a personal site.</p>\n<h3><a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2008/10/22/introducing-carrington">Carrington</a></h3>\n<p>Carrington is a new uber theme framework from my buddies at <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/">CrowdFavorite</a>.

Plus, it also defines &#8220;contexts&#8221; which let you use more specific views for certain special circumstances like &#8220;single post by Joe Smith&#8221;, posts by guest authors, and the like. It also lets you easily use different headers/footers/sidebars depending on category, or for specific pages.</p>\n<p>I think Carrington is going to define the next generation of WordPress themes.

Results would be analyzed and compared, leading to a second round of suggestions.

We all decided a more ambitious prototype was in order, one that would experiment with a new approach to screen real estate and attempt to address as many of the issues from 2.5 as was possible with a few extra weeks of time. A rapid design process was followed by an even more rapid development cycle. The second prototype is what you know as Crazyhorse. </p>\n<p>The second round of testing blew everyone away. The research team had never seen such consistent results. Tasks were completed faster, participant opinions rated it higher, understanding of how interface elements worked was greater, and it wasn&#8217;t even a fully functional application.

(Use Google and you can see audience videos of the presentation.)</p>\n<p>Here, then, is a PDF of reasonable size that you can download and peruse at your leisure that outlines the usability testing project in some detail. I wanted to include some eye tracking videos, but the file was so huge it would have been ridiculous for anyone to download it, so I stuck with eye tracking outputs called gaze trails to illustrate the findings. I also tried to pare down the text to the more salient points, since more than 50 hours of test video really does reveal an insane amount of data. I also cut out the section about designing Crazyhorse in the interest of staying under 25 pages. Hopefully you&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s a good balance. I&#8217;ll try to put together a separate document on the design process of 2.7 in a couple of weeks that will include the early Crazyhorse material. </p>\n<p>So, if you want to know what we learned from the usability testing this summer that caused us to create what is now 2.7, go ahead and read the report. </p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2008/10/wp-testreport-205-crazyhorse-1028a08jw.pdf">WordPress 2.5/Crazyhorse Usability Testing Report (PDF)</a></p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Wed, 29 Oct 2008 00:06:33 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:10:"Jane Wells";}s:7:"summary";s:4402:"<p>A question I hear pretty frequently is, &#8220;Why a redesign of the admin panel so soon after 2.5?&#8221; Those who have attended WordCamps in the past few months have already heard the answer, but for the people who haven&#8217;t had that opportunity, this post is for you. </p>\n<p>When the community response to the 2.5 admin redesign was mixed, it seemed like a good idea to do usability testing to find out which issues were based on actual interface problems vs. which complaints were just a result of not liking change.

I also cut out the section about designing Crazyhorse in the interest of staying under 25 pages. Hopefully you&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s a good balance. I&#8217;ll try to put together a separate document on the design process of 2.7 in a couple of weeks that will include the early Crazyhorse material. </p>\n<p>So, if you want to know what we learned from the usability testing this summer that caused us to create what is now 2.7, go ahead and read the report. </p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2008/10/wp-testreport-205-crazyhorse-1028a08jw.pdf">WordPress 2.5/Crazyhorse Usability Testing Report (PDF)</a></p>";}i:2;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:60:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Plugin Releases for 10/28";s:4:"guid";s:40:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=4449";s:4:"link";s:88:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/10/28/wordpress-plugin-releases-for-1028/";s:11:"description";s:3160:"<h3>New Plugins</h3>\n<p><a href="http://sww.co.nz/wordpress-plugins/flexi-quote-rotator/"><strong>Flexi Quote Rotator</strong></a></p>\n<p>Add the quotations to your site using a shortcode or php snippet in template.

You can download it from the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/carrington-blog">WordPress theme directory</a>. You can also purchase Carrington from the <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/store/">Crowd Favorite store</a>. This isn&#8217;t required, as we also make it available for free; but Carrington is definitely a <img src="http://alexking.org/images/smilies/ak_scare1.gif" alt=":scare:" class="wp-smiley" /> premium <img src="http://alexking.org/images/smilies/ak_scare2.gif" alt=":/scare:" class="wp-smiley" /> theme and has real value. The more people purchase it, the more we can dedicate resources to improving it and building new Carrington themes.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/download/carrington-blog.1.1.zip" class="download">Download Carrington Blog</a> version 1.1</p>\n<p>Carrington Blog is our first theme released on the Carrington framework.</p>\n<h3>Changes in Version 1.1</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>There is now a setting to allow you to set how many posts should appear on the archives pages (seperately from the home page).</li>\n<li>Added parent-{page-slug}.php support to enable custom content display for sub-pages.</li>\n<li>Support cat-{slug}.php, etc. template support throughout all top level directories (header, footer, sidebar, etc.).</li>\n<li>Some IDs were converted to CLASSes to remove in-page ID conflicts (due to AJAX loading of templates).</li>\n<li>Firefox 2 compatibility for drop-down menus.</li>\n<li>Improved ShareThis compatibility with AJAX archives loading.</li>\n<li>Additional classes for misc. support.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why Did We Build It?</h3>\n<p>At <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com">Crowd Favorite</a> we build a lot of &#8220;WordPress as a CMS&#8221; powered web sites. WordPress makes a great, easily customizable, CMS back-end; and Carrington is the perfect compliment for it on the front-end.</p>\n<p>We wanted to simplify how we built these highly customized sites. We wanted to make them easier and faster to build, and simpler to maintain. Carrington is our solution.</p>\n<h3>Framework = Convention Over Code</h3>\n<p>The main win from a framework is the move to convention over code. Instead of writing a bunch of code to accomplish something, using the supported naming conventions and the framework takes care of the heavy lifting for you.</p>\n<p>By standardizing file naming conventions and template hierarchy (while retaining compatibility with WordPress theme standards), and including functionality to act on these standards, Carrington makes it dead simple to implement commonly requested theme features. These include a custom design/format for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>posts in the &#8220;Tech News&#8221; category</li>\n<li>posts by a Joe Smith</li>\n<li>posts by contributing authors</li>\n<li>comments by the post author</li>\n<li>comments by registered users</li>\n<li>search results</li>\n<li>custom footer/header/sidebar for page X or category Y</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Carrington allows you to stop cluttering your templates with conditional logic and just build your templates. The framework will take care of the logic for you.</p>\n<h3>The Details</h3>\n<p>The WordPress engine prepares data for a page and hands it off to the theme and it&#8217;s the theme&#8217;s job to make that look right to the end user. Carrington takes that data, and makes a bunch of intelligent decisions about how the page should be displayed.</p>\n<p>The override system looks at the page to display, and the available templates, and goes through a series of checks to see which templates to use at each level. Don&#8217;t worry; you aren&#8217;t stuck with the evaluation order we chose. The order in which the fallbacks are processed (and the final decisions on templates) can be overridden by plugins using <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/carrington/readme/#carrington-actionsandfilters">actions and filters</a> - using the standard WordPress system. This means that if you want your author role template to be more important than your category template (or vice versa), it&#8217;s a simple matter of a couple line plugin (and can even be placed in Carrington&#8217;s plugins/ directory for easy distribution with the file). Of course, we are happy to provide development services to help build these plugins or customizations.</p>\n<p>The core of the Carrington engine is in the function.php and functions/ directory. That&#8217;s where the magic happens. The rest of the theme is organized into template files in different directories. There are a lot more directories here than you normally see in a WP theme because Carrington abstracts the theme elements to their atomic pieces. This enables you to have a template that displays a post, comment<sup><a href="http://alexking.org/blog/feed?cat=16#fn1224599962888n" id="fn1224599962888" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, etc.</p>\n<p>These atomic templates enable the AJAX loading features you see in Carrington. People have long asked me to release the <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2007/01/02/ajax-archives">AJAX loading features</a> you see on this site, but I couldn&#8217;t really do it (until now) because it required this kind of theme abstraction and most themes don&#8217;t support it.</p>\n<p>Every directory in Carrington has a pretty thorough README file (you can also access <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/carrington/readme/">this documentation</a> online). These files explain how the templates in the given directory are used, and what named templates are supported for this directory. These took a while to write, and could probably use some more detail (I&#8217;m not a tech writer), but they are a very good start and have been part of Carrington since 1.0.</p>\n<h3>Online Resources</h3>\n<p>This is still a little bit in-flux, but we&#8217;ve got the following set up so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/carrington-blog">Download</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/store/">Buy</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://carringtontheme.com">Live demo</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/carrington/readme/">Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/forums/">Forum</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Carrington&#8217;s Future</h3>\n<p>Expect to see some new themes from us based on the Carrington framework in the future - we&#8217;ve just scratched the surface of what Carrington can do here.

With a community as vocal as this one, it&#8217;s always a little nerve-wracking to introduce change, but this time it seems like the change was welcomed, which has been great. I&#8217;m hopeful that as we introduce the new features of 2.7 over the coming weeks, the good feelings will continue. As promised, here&#8217;s a rundown of what&#8217;s going to happen to the Dashboard over the next couple of weeks before launch.</p>\n<p><strong>Menus</strong><br />\nI described the menu functions last week, but I forgot to mention something. By default, when you arrive at your Dashboard the first time, two sections of the navigation will be expanded: the Dashboard section (because it is active, so it will have the color highlight) and the Posts section (because it has often-accessed screens in it, and will serve as a cue that you can view other section menus without loading new screens). Once you start clicking menus open and closed, your browser will cookie you, and will remember your menu state. So if you open Posts and Comments, when you come back the next time, Posts and Comments will be open. If you click into your Settings, Posts and Comments will still be open. You&#8217;ll need to manually close nav sections. We went back and forth on this, and there was community discussion about perhaps only allowing two sections to be open at a time, but ultimately those approaches would have removed control from the user. And since the mantra of 2.7 is to give the user control over his/her admin interface, we chose to keeps things open if the user had opened them.</p>\n<p><strong>Contextual Access Tabs</strong><br />\nIn the upper right, drop-tabs provide access to contextual features displayed in a layer that appears between the header and the main working area. Screen Options will allow you to choose which modules to display on the current screen. Don&#8217;t like seeing the Incoming Links module because no one links to you? A simple checkbox in the Options tab will remove the module from your Dashboard until you decide to reinstate it. Help will highlight some of the changes since the previous version, and provide links to help resources such as FAQ/Forums/Contact Support for .com and Documentation/Support Forums for .org.</p>\n<p><strong>Module Layout</strong><br />\nIn addition to using the Options tab to decide which modules to display on the Dashboard, all the modules on the Dashboard may be moved up or down or between columns using drag and drop. Modules also may be collapsed or expanded by clicking the title bar, allowing another level of screen customization. In 2.8, we also hope to make every single module configurable in terms of what content it displays&#8230; we ran out of time for this in 2.7, so for now only the newsfeed modules will be configurable. When you hover over the module, a link will appear in the module header  allowing access to the configuration view.</p>\n<p><strong>Right Now</strong><br />\nThe Right Now module contains the same data as before, but it&#8217;s been rearranged to provide a clearer display. This list style, as opposed to the previous sentence style, will also make translation for non-English sites easier. Color cues help to highlight things that are not good (red), things that are pending (yellow/orange), and things that are good to go (green).</p>\n<p><strong>Stats</strong><br />\nI&#8217;d like to apologize for having a non-core piece of functionality on the Dashboard comp. It&#8217;s my fault&#8230; when we were working on the comps, we used my wireframes and my live 2.7 Dashboard to assemble our elements, and I forgot that I had the <a title="WordPress.com stats plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/">WordPress.com stats plugin</a> installed and a module on my Dashboard. So even though it&#8217;s not in core and it turns out the WordPress.com stats plugin is undergoing some reworking of its own, we made the Dashboard stats module easier to scan than the one I currently see when I log in. For those of you on .org who got excited when you saw the Dashboard comp with stats, again, I apologize for the oversight on my part. If you want the candy-like stats goodness we comped up you&#8217;d need to install the plugin (or another stats plugin with candy-like elements). There should be a fine-looking Dashboard module as part of the update they release. </p>\n<p><strong>QuickPress</strong><br />\nQuickPress is a new feature that provides the ability to start (or publish) a simple post from the Dashboard when you don&#8217;t need the full feature set of the Add New Post screen. Currently, these posts can contain title, text, media and tags. In 2.8 we hope to make the module configurable, so that each user can decide which few fields make the most sense to display. If you Save as Draft, you will see the new draft appear in the Recent Drafts module right away. Clicking Cancel will clear the form. Publish publishes the post. Posts made using QuickPress are the same as other posts and may be editing by going to Posts &gt; Edit and selecting the post in question. One last thing: both in this module and on the Add New post screen, we&#8217;ve put as much space as possible between the Save Draft and Publish buttons, so for all of you who&#8217;ve asked at WordCamps or emailed or posted somewhere to request this, ta da! Hopefully this will reduce accidental publications.</p>\n<p><strong>Recent Drafts</strong><br />\nDuring the summer testing, one thing we heard over and over was the desire to access recent drafts more easily, preferably with one click from the Dashboard (as opposed to clicking on Drafts from the Right Now module, waiting for page to load, then clicking on a specific draft title and waiting for a second page load). The Recent Drafts module is meant to address that need, displaying the five most recent drafts with the date they were created. In a future version, this module will be configurable as well. In the meantime, if you&#8217;re a crosswords-in-pen kind of person and you don&#8217;t write drafts, just use the Options tab at the top to hide the Drafts module, and it won&#8217;t take up space on your Dashboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Feeds</strong><br />\nNews feeds of WordPress-related news will function largely the same as they did in 2.6 in terms of configurability, and will simply have a new look. You can still specify the URL of the feed, how many items to display, whether to show headline vs excerpt, author, date, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Incoming Links</strong><br />\nJust getting a face lift. Or maybe not a face lift, more like a visit to the Clinique counter.</p>\n<p><strong>Hooks</strong><br />\nPlugins can still add modules to the Dashboard. They also still can add top-level menu items if necessary (as opposed to having them in Tools, Plugins, Settings or wherever&#8230;like Posts if it&#8217;s post-specific). Because we&#8217;ll be using iconography in the collapsed menu state, plugins that create top-level menus can create an icon for use in the menu system. When there&#8217;s no icon associated with the plugin, a default will be used (kind of the way some blogs show default avatars when no Gravatar is associated with a commenter on your blog). Hopefully, though, most plugins will fit within existing section headers, since our &#8220;top level&#8221; is not actually made up of menu items, but section headers that open to reveal the real menu items that have screens associated with them. Plugins can also put themselves into the Shortcuts/Favorites menu in the header. </p>\n<p><strong>Recent Comments</strong><br />\nThis module, as in 2.6, displays the most recent comments. However, you now can moderate comments directly from this Dashboard module, including the new Comment Reply feature. For now it will show only the last x number of comments, as it does currently, though in 2.8 we hope to add more configurability to this, or roll it into the Inbox concept.</p>\n<p><strong>Bye-Bye Inbox</strong><br />\nFor those who were at WordCamp SF or who were using the nightly builds while there was still an Inbox placeholder, sorry, no Inbox in 2.7. It turned out to be far more complex than anticipated, and rather than including something rushed and clunky, we&#8217;re holding off until a later version. We added the comment moderation to the Comments module to make up for it, so you don&#8217;t have to wait for that, at least.</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s the new Dashboard. A little more usable, a little prettier, a little more you, a little cooler. Or maybe a lot of all those things. We&#8217;ll let you be the judge.</p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Mon, 20 Oct 2008 18:09:35 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:10:"Jane Wells";}s:7:"summary";s:8845:"<p>First, I&#8217;d like to say that I&#8217;m glad the majority response to the <a title="The Visual Design of 2.7" href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/10/the-visual-design-of-27/">screenshots we posted last week</a> was so positive.

They also still can add top-level menu items if necessary (as opposed to having them in Tools, Plugins, Settings or wherever&#8230;like Posts if it&#8217;s post-specific). Because we&#8217;ll be using iconography in the collapsed menu state, plugins that create top-level menus can create an icon for use in the menu system. When there&#8217;s no icon associated with the plugin, a default will be used (kind of the way some blogs show default avatars when no Gravatar is associated with a commenter on your blog). Hopefully, though, most plugins will fit within existing section headers, since our &#8220;top level&#8221; is not actually made up of menu items, but section headers that open to reveal the real menu items that have screens associated with them. Plugins can also put themselves into the Shortcuts/Favorites menu in the header. </p>\n<p><strong>Recent Comments</strong><br />\nThis module, as in 2.6, displays the most recent comments. However, you now can moderate comments directly from this Dashboard module, including the new Comment Reply feature. For now it will show only the last x number of comments, as it does currently, though in 2.8 we hope to add more configurability to this, or roll it into the Inbox concept.</p>\n<p><strong>Bye-Bye Inbox</strong><br />\nFor those who were at WordCamp SF or who were using the nightly builds while there was still an Inbox placeholder, sorry, no Inbox in 2.7. It turned out to be far more complex than anticipated, and rather than including something rushed and clunky, we&#8217;re holding off until a later version. We added the comment moderation to the Comments module to make up for it, so you don&#8217;t have to wait for that, at least.</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s the new Dashboard. A little more usable, a little prettier, a little more you, a little cooler. Or maybe a lot of all those things. We&#8217;ll let you be the judge.</p>";}i:28;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:58:"Lorelle on WP: Web Weavers Workshop with Lorelle in Hawaii";s:4:"guid";s:36:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/?p=3121";s:4:"link";s:84:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/10/20/web-weavers-workshop-with-lorelle-in-hawaii/";s:11:"description";s:5378:"<div class="snap_preview"><br /><p><a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/tag/wordpress-news/" title="WordPress News"><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/wpnews1.png" alt="WordPress News" align="right" /></a>Come join me, Wednesday, October 22, 2008, for a day long workshop in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The long months of your tolerance and forbearance as you suffered through the inelegance of our hacked-together, leftover  Crazyhorse interface are almost at an end. (Was it really that painful?)</p>\n<p>The visuals you have been craving are finally finished enough to show, and have been approved by the lead developers. We hope you like them. Mad props to Matt Thomas and Andy Peatling for their visual talents. You can expect these designs to be extended to the rest of the 2.7 screens and implemented over the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>So now that we finally nailed down the look, how&#8217;s it going to work? The menu system in particular has been the topic of discussion on the hackers and testers lists, so I thought I would take this opportunity to explain how we plan for it to work. As you know, one of the goals of 2.7 was to reduce the necessity to load new screens just to access sub-navigation menus; we wanted the most-used screens to be within a click or two at most. If you&#8217;ve been using the nightly builds, you got used to the arrow controls that allowed you to expand and contract the menus. Then you got used to the box-style with icons that not only opened and closed vertically, but could be minimized horizontally as well, leaving a remnant of icons to provide a kind of &#8220;advanced mode,&#8221; though you don&#8217;t need to be particularly advanced to use it. Now that we have real button styles (the icons are still placeholders, and we hope to have some new ones soonish), we&#8217;ve nailed down the menu functionality.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="2.7 New Post Screen, Unfinished" src="http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/newpost.png" alt="2.7 New Post Screen, Unfinished" width="597" height="402" /><p class="wp-caption-text">2.7 New Post Screen, Unfinished</p></div>\n<p>Each section header has three parts: the icon on the left, the blue link text, and the area to the right where an expansion arrow appears on hover or in expanded state. You can see that the arrow is contained in a small segment of the header, similar to the way the favorites menu is structured. If you click on this segment, the menu will expand to show the choices in that section.  Click again to close the menu. Click on the blue link text and you will go directly to the screen for the first choice in that section, where the section menu will be opened to show you the other section choices. Double-click on the section icon and the menu will close horizontally, leaving the icon list visible.

The long months of your tolerance and forbearance as you suffered through the inelegance of our hacked-together, leftover  Crazyhorse interface are almost at an end. (Was it really that painful?)</p>\n<p>The visuals you have been craving are finally finished enough to show, and have been approved by the lead developers. We hope you like them. Mad props to Matt Thomas and Andy Peatling for their visual talents. You can expect these designs to be extended to the rest of the 2.7 screens and implemented over the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>So now that we finally nailed down the look, how&#8217;s it going to work? The menu system in particular has been the topic of discussion on the hackers and testers lists, so I thought I would take this opportunity to explain how we plan for it to work. As you know, one of the goals of 2.7 was to reduce the necessity to load new screens just to access sub-navigation menus; we wanted the most-used screens to be within a click or two at most. If you&#8217;ve been using the nightly builds, you got used to the arrow controls that allowed you to expand and contract the menus. Then you got used to the box-style with icons that not only opened and closed vertically, but could be minimized horizontally as well, leaving a remnant of icons to provide a kind of &#8220;advanced mode,&#8221; though you don&#8217;t need to be particularly advanced to use it. Now that we have real button styles (the icons are still placeholders, and we hope to have some new ones soonish), we&#8217;ve nailed down the menu functionality.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="2.7 New Post Screen, Unfinished" src="http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/newpost.png" alt="2.7 New Post Screen, Unfinished" width="597" height="402" /><p class="wp-caption-text">2.7 New Post Screen, Unfinished</p></div>\n<p>Each section header has three parts: the icon on the left, the blue link text, and the area to the right where an expansion arrow appears on hover or in expanded state. You can see that the arrow is contained in a small segment of the header, similar to the way the favorites menu is structured. If you click on this segment, the menu will expand to show the choices in that section.  Click again to close the menu. Click on the blue link text and you will go directly to the screen for the first choice in that section, where the section menu will be opened to show you the other section choices. Double-click on the section icon and the menu will close horizontally, leaving the icon list visible. In this state, hovering over the icons will display the menus for each section, so you&#8217;re still only a click away from most screens. Double-click on an icon when the menu is closed this way and it will take you to the first screen in that section.

And he wants your help. Over the next month or so, Amir will be taking your advice on this blog to help him create his community tourist site with WordPress. As with all such endeavors, it begins with a plan.</em></p>\n<p><strong>By <a href="http://www.icanlocalize.com" title="Amir Helzer">Amir Helzer</a></strong></p>\n<p><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/bariloche1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" title="bariloche Island Mountains" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3109" />I&#8217;ve been living in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariloche" title="Bariloche, Argentina">Bariloche, Argentina</a>, for the past few years. It&#8217;s a small town, so folks know each other pretty well.  A popular tourist destination, everyone here is doing something with tourists, from renting out cabañas to ski instructors, trout fishing guides to para-gliding. As a web expert, friends often ask if I can help them build a website for their business. They hear that it&#8217;s a good way to get new business, especially rich folks from the US and Europe. We may be a calm and relaxing vacation destination, however, we are also determined business people.</p>\n<p>Most locals are familiar with static websites, with enough content for a contact page and photo gallery showing off the same tourist images of Bariloche. Recently, I decided instead of meeting their needs individually, I would create a community site for tourist information with WordPress. It will be called <a href="http://www.baripedia.com" title="Baripedia">Baripedia</a>.</p>\n<p>This is not a common project and I need your help and input to make this tourist community site work with WordPress. I&#8217;ll be asking WordPress to do a lot of things that stretch it in many ways, ways we aren&#8217;t very familiar with. I think it&#8217;s the right tool for the job, but making WordPress do what we ask of it pushes it beyond its traditional usage. Want to help?</p>\n<h3>The Challenges of a Community Tourist Site</h3>\n<p>Most businesses appearing on Baripedia will need the basics and a bit more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A few &#8217;static&#8217; pages, like a home page and details about different things they offer.</li>\n<li>A contact page.</li>\n<li>Order processing, so that visitors can pay online for products, lodging, and services.</li>\n<li>News and events.</li>\n<li>Map locater (such as Google maps, but it isn&#8217;t available in Argentina).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a variety of challenges facing a community site focused on tourism. It must represent the community as well as each business involved. Here are some of the challenges involved:</p>\n<p>Each company must have a page of information about their products and services with contact information.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ecommerce WordPress Plugins must also serve each individual company from within the site.</li>\n<li>We need to decide how to incorporate each business into the site.

And he wants your help. Over the next month or so, Amir will be taking your advice on this blog to help him create his community tourist site with WordPress. As with all such endeavors, it begins with a plan.</em></p>\n<p><strong>By <a href="http://www.icanlocalize.com" title="Amir Helzer">Amir Helzer</a></strong></p>\n<p><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/bariloche1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" title="bariloche Island Mountains" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3109" />I&#8217;ve been living in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariloche" title="Bariloche, Argentina">Bariloche, Argentina</a>, for the past few years. It&#8217;s a small town, so folks know each other pretty well.  A popular tourist destination, everyone here is doing something with tourists, from renting out cabañas to ski instructors, trout fishing guides to para-gliding. As a web expert, friends often ask if I can help them build a website for their business. They hear that it&#8217;s a good way to get new business, especially rich folks from the US and Europe. We may be a calm and relaxing vacation destination, however, we are also determined business people.</p>\n<p>Most locals are familiar with static websites, with enough content for a contact page and photo gallery showing off the same tourist images of Bariloche. Recently, I decided instead of meeting their needs individually, I would create a community site for tourist information with WordPress. It will be called <a href="http://www.baripedia.com" title="Baripedia">Baripedia</a>.</p>\n<p>This is not a common project and I need your help and input to make this tourist community site work with WordPress. I&#8217;ll be asking WordPress to do a lot of things that stretch it in many ways, ways we aren&#8217;t very familiar with. I think it&#8217;s the right tool for the job, but making WordPress do what we ask of it pushes it beyond its traditional usage. Want to help?</p>\n<h3>The Challenges of a Community Tourist Site</h3>\n<p>Most businesses appearing on Baripedia will need the basics and a bit more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A few &#8217;static&#8217; pages, like a home page and details about different things they offer.</li>\n<li>A contact page.</li>\n<li>Order processing, so that visitors can pay online for products, lodging, and services.</li>\n<li>News and events.</li>\n<li>Map locater (such as Google maps, but it isn&#8217;t available in Argentina).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a variety of challenges facing a community site focused on tourism. It must represent the community as well as each business involved. Here are some of the challenges involved:</p>\n<p>Each company must have a page of information about their products and services with contact information.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ecommerce WordPress Plugins must also serve each individual company from within the site.</li>\n<li>We need to decide how to incorporate each business into the site. Should we use <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/" title="WordPressMU" rel="tag">WordPressMU</a> and give each business their own &#8220;blog&#8221; with a front entry blog that links all of the individual ones within the network together? Or have one self-hosted version of WordPress that serves all the businesses?</li>\n<li>Decide how much &#8220;freedom&#8221; and control each business would have over their &#8220;pages&#8221; and content. What if one business gets into blogging and writes over 100 blog posts quickly while the others write only a couple?</li>\n<li>Decide what content will go into the community site and which business will contribute what content. Do we need a community editor that will keep the blog going or will each business contribute fairly equally?</li>\n<li>Decide the format of the design and structure. Will it be a newspaper/magazine style, or should it be more commercial and aimed strictly towards high end vacation customers? Or maybe it should be very community-oriented and &#8220;friendly&#8221;, representing the relaxed tourist community?</li>\n<li>We need functions that are not blog-oriented, such as table views of different businesses with filtering and sorting features.

This first one is going to be a little long, and I&#8217;ve been editing the draft off-and-on for over a week. Future articles will probably be shorter, in general, and focus on a particular subject. But let&#8217;s start out by looking at the current state of this website. We&#8217;ll examine what is good, what I think needs changing, and I&#8217;ll point out some recent changes I&#8217;ve already made, and why.</p>\n<p>In later installments, I will begin making changes to the site, and we can examine how and why those changes were made. I hope that by following along, you will be able to learn a little something that might help you see ways to improve your own site. Below, I&#8217;ll lay out some of the topics that I will be touching on. If there is something in particular you&#8217;d like me to address, let me know, and maybe I can add it to the list.</p>\n<p><span id="more-1120"></span></p>\n<h3>Where we are now</h3>\n<p>Currently, the base theme for the site is <a title="Sandbox theme for WordPress" href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/">Sandbox</a>, which is a great &#8220;bare-bones&#8221; template to implement a <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym> design around. Sandbox has good <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization"><span class="caps">SEO</span></acronym> (Search Engine Optimization)  features, well-structured semantic <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym>, <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformat</a> generation, and an excellent system of contextually generated class attributes which let you style your site using <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym> based on a wide variety of factors for the page a visitor is currently viewing. Which is a complicated way of saying that it generates lots of classes in the <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym> that you can use to do fancy things in your stylesheets.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been using several plugins to add minor improvements here and there. Some of the main plugins are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search-everything/">Search Everything</a> &#8212; extends the default WordPress search to include pages and comments</li>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easygravatars/">Easy Gravatars</a> &#8212; my own plugin, adds Gravatars to comments without modifying the theme files</li>\n<li><a href="http://sharethis.com/">ShareThis</a> &#8212; allows visitors to easily share my links on popular social networking sites like Delicious and Reddit</li>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-tags/">Simple Tags</a> &#8212; extra tag management features, tag cloud</li>\n<li><a href="http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/">Subscribe to Comments</a> &#8212; allow visitors to subscribe to post comments via email</li>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/">Twitter Tools</a> &#8212; display my latest Twitter updates in my sidebar</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.bencoleman.co.uk/flickr-widget-plugin-for-your-wordpress-sidebar/">Flickr Badge Widget</a> &#8212; display random photos from my Flickr photo stream</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, some of these plugins are &#8220;decorative&#8221; in nature (Easy Gravatars, Twitter Tools, Flickr Badge). Others are to improve the site&#8217;s usability to visitors (Search Everything), others are to encourage &#8220;stickiness&#8221; (Subscribe to Comments, ShareThis). And there are plugins to make things easier for me, the site owner (Simple Tags).</p>\n<p>I use many more plugins than those listed above (nearly 40 all together), but that list will give you an idea of some of the more visible ones, and why I use them.</p>\n<h3>A few personal touches</h3>\n<p>For some features, I either couldn&#8217;t find an existing plugin that worked like I wanted, or the plugins I found were overkill for my purposes. I wanted to avoid modifying template files in the same way that you want to avoid modifying core WordPress files. So one thing I&#8217;ve done is to create a special plugin called &#8220;My Local Customizations&#8221;.</p>\n<p>This plugin handles several things that are specific to my site, but not tied down to whatever theme I might be using. For example, it is responsible for adding in the scripts for Google Analytics and other traffic metric services, adds extra metadata to my pages, adds a &#8220;related posts&#8221; section (aided by the Simple Tags plugin), and it defines a customized &#8220;nice_excerpt&#8221; function that some of my archive pages use. I&#8217;ll probably give more details about nice excerpts in a future article.</p>\n<h3>Room for improvement</h3>\n<p>For some time now, I&#8217;ve been using the &#8220;Rockem Sockem Robots&#8221; image for my &#8220;branding&#8221;. There was no particular reason for choosing it, other than I had taken the photo, and wanted to use it for something. In a long-ago redesign of my site, I stuck it in my header, and began using the robot image as my avatar shortly afterwards. The robot branding is fun and fine for small-scale personal usage, but if I ever want to have personal branding that I could use for business purposes, I would start running up against trademark issues. As a result, I am planning to phase out the robot images, but I haven&#8217;t settled on a definite replacement yet.</p>\n<p>In the earlier days of my site, I generally assumed that most of my visitors were pretty tech-savvy, and could find ways to keep up-to-date with my site on their own, if they wanted to. However, the blogosphere has changed since then, and I can&#8217;t always assume that someone who wishes to subscribe to my site knows how to let their tools find my syndication feeds, or knows to look around for a &#8220;subscribe by email&#8221; link. I need to do some work to bring these subscription options in front of people&#8217;s eyeballs, make them easy to find, so that I can make it easier for visitors to subscribe to, and revisit my site. Expect to see prominent subscription icons appear soon.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve got several stand-alone pages such as &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/about-this-site">About This Site</a>&#8220;, &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/contact">Contact</a>&#8220;, &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/donate">Donate</a>&#8220;, and &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/tagcloud">Tag Cloud</a>&#8220;. The About page has some information about me and this site, but I&#8217;m really not very happy with its current state. Likewise with the Contact and Donate pages: they are very basic, sometimes cluttered, and not terribly interesting. I&#8217;ll be touching those up somewhere along the way in this series of articles.</p>\n<p>Though I&#8217;ve created several plugins for WordPress, I haven&#8217;t done a lot to promote them, beyond announcing them and making occasional updates. There are several improvements I can make to help improve the visibility of those projects. For one thing, I will move them from posts to pages. Then I will create a special page template which will automatically include download links, a &#8220;call to action&#8221; for donations, and changelog information. I will also create a consolidated &#8220;projects&#8221; page which will list all of the projects, to make them easier to find.</p>\n<p>My sidebar is a cluttered, badly-organized mess. There are too many links, several of which are probably out of date. Many of the external links should be removed from the sidebar, and moved to a separate &#8220;resources&#8221; page. The sidebar will be reduced to primarily contain links with more information about myself, this site, and a few key external resources which are important to me (likely in the form of some kind of lifestream). I will also make context-sensitive sidebars, so that different sections will appear depending on whether you are viewing the home page, a single blog post, a plugin project page, archive pages, etc.</p>\n<p>My categories are also in a state of disarray. Back before we had real tag support in WordPress, I began using categories as tags. After we got tags in the core system, I began to regret that decision. As I&#8217;ve posted before, there are valid reasons to use both <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2007/09/22/tags-and-categories-in-wordpress">categories and tags</a>, for separate organizational purposes. I plan to slim down to a very small set of broad categories, with tags providing supplemental keyword metadata. In order to preserve any existing category <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator"><span class="caps">URL</span></acronym> pointers, this will require me to create some sort of redirection from the old categories to new tag archive URLs. This will likely be done in a custom 404 handler in the new theme, when I reach that stage of my redesign. Once I finish reaping the categories, I plan to give posts in each category a unique visual identity, by means of a standard icon for each one, and possibly a unique color scheme variation. This will make it easier for visitors to pick out the topics that interest them the most when skimming the site.</p>\n<p>Currently, I am using a very standard blog format &#8212; a header, sidebar, and a main content area containing ten posts. In the long  term, I plan to switch to a format more closely resembling an online magazine. The main content area will call more attention to just the most recent few articles, with just linked headlines to some of the less recent ones. I will probably switch from Sandbox to some other base theme, and modify it  to my needs. More on that later, when I make more decisions about how I want to arrange things.</p>\n<h3>Most recent changes</h3>\n<p>Even though change here has been slow, I have made a few improvements and additions recently. For example, I set up my feeds with FeedBurner and installed the FeedSmith plugin. For one thing, this finally gives me some idea about how many <acronym title="Rich Site Summary"><span class="caps">RSS</span></acronym>/Atom subscribers I have, about 500 &#8212; more than I thought, not as many as I would like. I will be doing more with this, such as using FeedBurner&#8217;s Email Subscription service so that visitors can receive site updates by email. I also installed the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/">All in One <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization"><span class="caps">SEO</span></acronym> Pack</a> plugin, which makes several good <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization"><span class="caps">SEO</span></acronym> improvements right out of the box. I installed the <a href="http://www.preblogging.com/increase-sociability/">Increase Sociability</a> plugin, which recognizes when a visitor arrives from Digg or StumbleUpon, and gives them an additional &#8220;call to action&#8221; to help share my site with others. And I began trying out the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/drain-hole/">Drain Hole</a> plugin (on my post about the <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2008/08/29/xcache-object-cache-plugin-for-wordpress-25">XCache object-cache plugin</a>), which is a precursor to the plugin page improvements I mentioned above.</p>\n<h3>Stay tuned&#8230;</h3>\n<p>So there is my &#8220;State of the Blog&#8221; update, and a rough plan for how I know I can improve my site. I&#8217;m no designer, but I&#8217;ll do my best to make the site not only function better, but to look better. Again, I hope that some of you will learn something as I progress, and if you have your own ideas that you think will improve the site, feel free to toss them into the pot!</p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 11:00:38 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:6:"Dougal";}s:7:"summary";s:12378:"<p><a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wordpress-wednesday.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1150" title="WordPress Wednesday" src="http://dougal.gunters.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wordpress-wednesday.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></a></p>\n<p>This is the first installment of &#8220;WordPress Wednesday&#8221;, which I mentioned in my previous post about <a title="It''s Time for Some Changes" href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2008/10/13/time-for-changes">making changes</a> to my site. This first one is going to be a little long, and I&#8217;ve been editing the draft off-and-on for over a week. Future articles will probably be shorter, in general, and focus on a particular subject. But let&#8217;s start out by looking at the current state of this website. We&#8217;ll examine what is good, what I think needs changing, and I&#8217;ll point out some recent changes I&#8217;ve already made, and why.</p>\n<p>In later installments, I will begin making changes to the site, and we can examine how and why those changes were made. I hope that by following along, you will be able to learn a little something that might help you see ways to improve your own site. Below, I&#8217;ll lay out some of the topics that I will be touching on. If there is something in particular you&#8217;d like me to address, let me know, and maybe I can add it to the list.</p>\n<p><span id="more-1120"></span></p>\n<h3>Where we are now</h3>\n<p>Currently, the base theme for the site is <a title="Sandbox theme for WordPress" href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/">Sandbox</a>, which is a great &#8220;bare-bones&#8221; template to implement a <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym> design around. Sandbox has good <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization"><span class="caps">SEO</span></acronym> (Search Engine Optimization)  features, well-structured semantic <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym>, <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformat</a> generation, and an excellent system of contextually generated class attributes which let you style your site using <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym> based on a wide variety of factors for the page a visitor is currently viewing. Which is a complicated way of saying that it generates lots of classes in the <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym> that you can use to do fancy things in your stylesheets.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been using several plugins to add minor improvements here and there. Some of the main plugins are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search-everything/">Search Everything</a> &#8212; extends the default WordPress search to include pages and comments</li>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easygravatars/">Easy Gravatars</a> &#8212; my own plugin, adds Gravatars to comments without modifying the theme files</li>\n<li><a href="http://sharethis.com/">ShareThis</a> &#8212; allows visitors to easily share my links on popular social networking sites like Delicious and Reddit</li>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-tags/">Simple Tags</a> &#8212; extra tag management features, tag cloud</li>\n<li><a href="http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/">Subscribe to Comments</a> &#8212; allow visitors to subscribe to post comments via email</li>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/">Twitter Tools</a> &#8212; display my latest Twitter updates in my sidebar</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.bencoleman.co.uk/flickr-widget-plugin-for-your-wordpress-sidebar/">Flickr Badge Widget</a> &#8212; display random photos from my Flickr photo stream</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, some of these plugins are &#8220;decorative&#8221; in nature (Easy Gravatars, Twitter Tools, Flickr Badge). Others are to improve the site&#8217;s usability to visitors (Search Everything), others are to encourage &#8220;stickiness&#8221; (Subscribe to Comments, ShareThis). And there are plugins to make things easier for me, the site owner (Simple Tags).</p>\n<p>I use many more plugins than those listed above (nearly 40 all together), but that list will give you an idea of some of the more visible ones, and why I use them.</p>\n<h3>A few personal touches</h3>\n<p>For some features, I either couldn&#8217;t find an existing plugin that worked like I wanted, or the plugins I found were overkill for my purposes. I wanted to avoid modifying template files in the same way that you want to avoid modifying core WordPress files. So one thing I&#8217;ve done is to create a special plugin called &#8220;My Local Customizations&#8221;.</p>\n<p>This plugin handles several things that are specific to my site, but not tied down to whatever theme I might be using. For example, it is responsible for adding in the scripts for Google Analytics and other traffic metric services, adds extra metadata to my pages, adds a &#8220;related posts&#8221; section (aided by the Simple Tags plugin), and it defines a customized &#8220;nice_excerpt&#8221; function that some of my archive pages use. I&#8217;ll probably give more details about nice excerpts in a future article.</p>\n<h3>Room for improvement</h3>\n<p>For some time now, I&#8217;ve been using the &#8220;Rockem Sockem Robots&#8221; image for my &#8220;branding&#8221;. There was no particular reason for choosing it, other than I had taken the photo, and wanted to use it for something. In a long-ago redesign of my site, I stuck it in my header, and began using the robot image as my avatar shortly afterwards. The robot branding is fun and fine for small-scale personal usage, but if I ever want to have personal branding that I could use for business purposes, I would start running up against trademark issues. As a result, I am planning to phase out the robot images, but I haven&#8217;t settled on a definite replacement yet.</p>\n<p>In the earlier days of my site, I generally assumed that most of my visitors were pretty tech-savvy, and could find ways to keep up-to-date with my site on their own, if they wanted to. However, the blogosphere has changed since then, and I can&#8217;t always assume that someone who wishes to subscribe to my site knows how to let their tools find my syndication feeds, or knows to look around for a &#8220;subscribe by email&#8221; link. I need to do some work to bring these subscription options in front of people&#8217;s eyeballs, make them easy to find, so that I can make it easier for visitors to subscribe to, and revisit my site. Expect to see prominent subscription icons appear soon.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve got several stand-alone pages such as &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/about-this-site">About This Site</a>&#8220;, &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/contact">Contact</a>&#8220;, &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/donate">Donate</a>&#8220;, and &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/tagcloud">Tag Cloud</a>&#8220;. The About page has some information about me and this site, but I&#8217;m really not very happy with its current state. Likewise with the Contact and Donate pages: they are very basic, sometimes cluttered, and not terribly interesting. I&#8217;ll be touching those up somewhere along the way in this series of articles.</p>\n<p>Though I&#8217;ve created several plugins for WordPress, I haven&#8217;t done a lot to promote them, beyond announcing them and making occasional updates. There are several improvements I can make to help improve the visibility of those projects. For one thing, I will move them from posts to pages. Then I will create a special page template which will automatically include download links, a &#8220;call to action&#8221; for donations, and changelog information. I will also create a consolidated &#8220;projects&#8221; page which will list all of the projects, to make them easier to find.</p>\n<p>My sidebar is a cluttered, badly-organized mess. There are too many links, several of which are probably out of date. Many of the external links should be removed from the sidebar, and moved to a separate &#8220;resources&#8221; page. The sidebar will be reduced to primarily contain links with more information about myself, this site, and a few key external resources which are important to me (likely in the form of some kind of lifestream). I will also make context-sensitive sidebars, so that different sections will appear depending on whether you are viewing the home page, a single blog post, a plugin project page, archive pages, etc.</p>\n<p>My categories are also in a state of disarray. Back before we had real tag support in WordPress, I began using categories as tags. After we got tags in the core system, I began to regret that decision. As I&#8217;ve posted before, there are valid reasons to use both <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2007/09/22/tags-and-categories-in-wordpress">categories and tags</a>, for separate organizational purposes. I plan to slim down to a very small set of broad categories, with tags providing supplemental keyword metadata. In order to preserve any existing category <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator"><span class="caps">URL</span></acronym> pointers, this will require me to create some sort of redirection from the old categories to new tag archive URLs. This will likely be done in a custom 404 handler in the new theme, when I reach that stage of my redesign. Once I finish reaping the categories, I plan to give posts in each category a unique visual identity, by means of a standard icon for each one, and possibly a unique color scheme variation. This will make it easier for visitors to pick out the topics that interest them the most when skimming the site.</p>\n<p>Currently, I am using a very standard blog format &#8212; a header, sidebar, and a main content area containing ten posts. In the long  term, I plan to switch to a format more closely resembling an online magazine. The main content area will call more attention to just the most recent few articles, with just linked headlines to some of the less recent ones. I will probably switch from Sandbox to some other base theme, and modify it  to my needs. More on that later, when I make more decisions about how I want to arrange things.</p>\n<h3>Most recent changes</h3>\n<p>Even though change here has been slow, I have made a few improvements and additions recently. For example, I set up my feeds with FeedBurner and installed the FeedSmith plugin. For one thing, this finally gives me some idea about how many <acronym title="Rich Site Summary"><span class="caps">RSS</span></acronym>/Atom subscribers I have, about 500 &#8212; more than I thought, not as many as I would like. I will be doing more with this, such as using FeedBurner&#8217;s Email Subscription service so that visitors can receive site updates by email. I also installed the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/">All in One <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization"><span class="caps">SEO</span></acronym> Pack</a> plugin, which makes several good <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization"><span class="caps">SEO</span></acronym> improvements right out of the box. I installed the <a href="http://www.preblogging.com/increase-sociability/">Increase Sociability</a> plugin, which recognizes when a visitor arrives from Digg or StumbleUpon, and gives them an additional &#8220;call to action&#8221; to help share my site with others. And I began trying out the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/drain-hole/">Drain Hole</a> plugin (on my post about the <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2008/08/29/xcache-object-cache-plugin-for-wordpress-25">XCache object-cache plugin</a>), which is a precursor to the plugin page improvements I mentioned above.</p>\n<h3>Stay tuned&#8230;</h3>\n<p>So there is my &#8220;State of the Blog&#8221; update, and a rough plan for how I know I can improve my site. I&#8217;m no designer, but I&#8217;ll do my best to make the site not only function better, but to look better. Again, I hope that some of you will learn something as I progress, and if you have your own ideas that you think will improve the site, feel free to toss them into the pot!</p>";}i:48;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:18:"Matt: Berlin Day 5";s:4:"guid";s:20:"http://ma.tt/?p=8165";s:4:"link";s:34:"http://ma.tt/2008/10/berlin-day-5/";s:11:"description";s:12680:"<p>Final day in
